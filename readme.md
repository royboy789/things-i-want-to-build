## Open Source Ideas & Solutions

If you are building something on this list, or know of a solve already in existance. send me a link.  
If you are actively building anything, let me know how I can help with the code.

## WordPress Unified UI

A JS and/or PHP library that allows developers to build UI code one time. 

Package would take configuration and generate blocks/widgets for:

- Elementor
- Beaver Builder

## Extend WPGraphQL

Leveraging [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) create a lib that helps generate custom queries, mutations, etc.

Taking inspiration from [WarAPI](https://github.com/SkyPressATX/war-api) by [SkyPressATX](https://github.com/SkyPressATX) ease of building out REST API endpoints.
